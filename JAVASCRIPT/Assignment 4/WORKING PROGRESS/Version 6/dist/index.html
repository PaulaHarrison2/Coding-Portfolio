            <h1>Wouldn't it be great if you could see what your room looked like before you painted it.</h1>
            <p>Sometimes it's really difficult to visualize what your existing furniture would look like with a different coloured palette on your walls.</p>
            <p>You could buy lots of paint samples and cover your walls in little patches of colour, but does that really help.</p>
            <p>In most cases, you just end up with a room looking even worse than it was before and a bigger decision of what colour to finally choose.</p>
            <p>Our new Room Colour Customizer is here to help you save money and time.</p>
            <h2>Room Colour Customizer</h2>
