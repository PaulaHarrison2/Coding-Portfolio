# Introduction

Hi, I'm Paula! ðŸ‘‹ I'm VERY NEW to the world of coding, and I'm excited to be diving into it (along with GitHub, which is another whole new adventure for me)!

## Background

Previously from a Design for Print background and now an online Business English teacher catering to senior executives at [@NTT Data](https://github.com/NTTData). Currently, I'm living off-grid in Spain, which adds an interesting twist to my learning journey.

## Learning Journey

I've just completed a [CodeFirstGirls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/) Kickstarter course in JavaScript, and I'm gearing up to start their Python course in a week's time.

## Approach

I'd describe myself as self-driven, proactive, and slightly obsessive (in the best possible way!). When faced with challenges, I tackle them head-on, fueled by my motivation to achieve my goals effectively. 

I have a natural inclination towards analysis, which helps me excel at dissecting complex problems and engineering innovative solutions. 

## Communication

Effective communication is key, and I pride myself on my excellent communication skills. Whether it's interacting with colleagues or stakeholders, I strive to ensure that communication is clear and productive.

## Project Approach

Throughout the JavaScript course, I've made it a point to push the boundaries. Instead of sticking to the typical 'Hello World' projects, I've tried to invent more challenging and fun assignments, constantly pushing myself to grow and learn.
From a designerâ€™s perspective, I would have liked the actual design layout of my final project to be more aesthetically pleasing, and needed to constantly remind myself that I was in fact a beginner at coding and should not be so hard on myself.
Despite this, I'm thrilled with the progress I've made within just 16 hours of instruction. I feel it showcases my dedication and rapid skill acquisition, which obviously involved a lot of additional reading and self-study, including diving into HTML and CSS, which had its own steep learning curve.

I chose to work independently on my final project, foregoing the opportunity to collaborate with a team. This decision stemmed from my extensive background in team environments, both in the design and teaching world as well as having a working schedule that allowed me to work unconventional hours.

## Fun Facts
On a personal note, as I mentioned earlier, I live off-grid in Spain, which has truly honed my skills. Achieving virtual self-sufficiency, I've mastered the art of constructing stone walls, built a swimming pool, and even wired my house to harness electricity from our solar panels
