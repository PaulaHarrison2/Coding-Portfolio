# Introduction

Hi, I'm Paula! üëã I'm VERY NEW to the world of coding, and I'm excited to be diving into it (along with GitHub, which is another whole new adventure for me)!

## Background

Previously from a Design for Print background and now an online Business English teacher in Spain focussing mainly on senior executives at [@NTT Data](https://github.com/NTTData). Currently, I'm living off-grid in Spain, which adds an interesting twist to my learning journey.

## Learning Journey

I've just completed a [CodeFirstGirls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/) Kickstarter course in JavaScript, and what a ride that's been!!
Although in the past I dabbled with web design using programs like Dreamweaver or Wix, in the last 8 weeks I've learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CodePen, Slack, GitHub (still to be determined). Which thinking back now is pretty amazing considering the actual instructional part of the course totalled 12 hours with the additional last 4 hours being about our final project.

I've spent every waking spare minute of my day coding. I've gone to bed counting code instead of sheep, I've woken up earlier than I needed to, just so I could do some coding before I started work. I've argued daily with Chat GPT when it gave me advice that I knew was wrong. I've found my conversations now consist of words like loop, array, conditions, functions, string. I battled internally every day as to why this has to be done with code, when drag and drop sufficed in the past, and why my design is limited because of my lack of coding knowledge.

I'm exhausted, I'm exhilarated. I pushed my boundaries to the limit. I feel like I've run a marathon, which is amazing because these days I don't run anywhere. But most of all I'm really proud of what I've achieved.
It's been a hell of a ride!!
But my story doesn't end there, because at the end of February I start the [CodeFirstGirls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/) Kickstarter Python course üòÅ

## Approach

I'd describe myself as self-driven, proactive, and slightly obsessive (in the best possible way!). When faced with challenges, I tackle them head-on, fueled by my motivation to achieve my goals effectively. 

I have a natural inclination towards analysis, which helps me excel at dissecting complex problems and engineering innovative solutions (normally in the middle of the night).
I'm also the queen of multi-tasking and have great time management skills.

## Communication

Effective communication is key, and I pride myself on my excellent communication skills. Whether it's interacting with colleagues or stakeholders, I strive to ensure that communication is clear and productive. Aparrently I'm a protagonist by nature and a great Team Leader üòâ

## Project Approach

Throughout the JavaScript course, I've made it a point to push the boundaries. Instead of sticking to the typical 'Hello World' projects, I've tried to invent more challenging and fun assignments, constantly pushing myself to grow and learn.
From a designer‚Äôs perspective, I would have liked the actual design layout of my final project to be more aesthetically pleasing, and needed to constantly remind myself that I was in fact a beginner at coding and should not be so hard on myself.
Despite this, I'm thrilled with the progress I've made. I feel it showcases my dedication and rapid skill acquisition, which obviously involved a lot of additional reading and self-study, including diving into HTML and CSS, which had its own steep learning curve.

I chose to work independently on my final project, foregoing the opportunity to collaborate with a team. This decision stemmed from my extensive background in team environments, both as a participant and a leader in the design and teaching world, as well as having a working schedule that allowed me to work unconventional hours.

## Fun Facts
On a personal note, as I mentioned earlier, I live off-grid in Spain, which has truly honed my skills. Achieving virtual self-sufficiency, I've mastered the art of constructing stone walls, built a swimming pool, and even wired my house to harness electricity from our solar panels.

## My Oscar Finale
And finally the thanks. I would like to thank [CodeFirstGirls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/) for this great opportunity, my instructors for their support and patience, my classmates for their hearts, medals, claps and star emojis and [@Commercetools.com](https://github.com/commercetools) for sponsoring the course. 

But most importantly my husband. The man that has put food and drink in front of me for the last 8 weeks. The man that has convinced me I can do this when I struggled, and the man that has done all of this with barely a grunt of thanks in return. üíñ
