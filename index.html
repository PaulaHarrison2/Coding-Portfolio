<div class="sub-heading">About me</div><p>
<div class="small-heading">Introduction</div>
<div class="additional-text">
Hi, I'm Paula! üëã I'm VERY NEW to the world of coding, and I'm excited to be diving into it (along with GitHub, which is another whole new adventure for me)!
</div><p>
<div class="small-heading">Background</div>
<div class="additional-text">
Previously from a Design for Print background and now an online Business English teacher in Spain focussing mainly on senior executives at <a href="https://es.nttdata.com/">NTT Data</a>. <p>Currently, I'm living off-grid in Spain, which adds an interesting twist to my learning journey.
</div>
<div class="small-heading">Learning Journey</div>
<div class="additional-text"> 
I've just completed a <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/">CodeFirstGirls</a> Kickstarter course in JavaScript, and what a ride that's been!!
<p>Although in the past I dabbled with web design using programs like Dreamweaver or Wix, in the last 8 weeks I've learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CodePen, Slack, GitHub (still to be determined). Which thinking back now is pretty amazing considering the actual instructional part of the course totalled 12 hours with the additional last 4 hours being about our final project.
<p>I've spent every waking spare minute of my day coding. I've gone to bed counting code instead of sheep, I've woken up earlier than I needed to, just so I could do some coding before I started work. I've argued daily with Chat GPT when it gave me advice that I knew was wrong. I've found my conversations now consist of words like loop, array, conditions, functions, string. I battled internally every day as to why this has to be done with code, when drag and drop sufficed in the past, and why my design is limited because of my lack of coding knowledge.
<p>I'm exhausted, I'm exhilarated. I pushed my boundaries to the limit. I feel like I've run a marathon, which is amazing because these days I don't run anywhere. But most of all I'm really proud of what I've achieved.
<p>It's been a hell of a ride!!
<p>But my story doesn't end there, because at the end of March I start the <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/">CodeFirstGirls</a> Kickstarter Python course üòÅ
  </div>
      <span id="moreText" style="display:none;">
<div class="small-heading">Approach</div>
<div class="additional-text"> 
I'd describe myself as self-driven, proactive, and slightly obsessive (in the best possible way!). When faced with challenges, I tackle them head-on, fueled by my motivation to achieve my goals effectively. 
<p>I have a natural inclination towards analysis, which helps me excel at dissecting complex problems and engineering innovative solutions (normally in the middle of the night).
<p>I'm also the queen of multi-tasking and have great time management skills.
</div>
  <div class="small-heading">Communication</div>
<div class="additional-text"> 
Effective communication is key, and I pride myself on my excellent communication skills. Whether it's interacting with colleagues or stakeholders, I strive to ensure that communication is clear and productive. Aparrently I'm a protagonist by nature and a great Team Leader üòâ
</div> <p>
  <div class="small-heading">Project Approach</div>
<div class="additional-text">
Throughout the JavaScript course, I've made it a point to push the boundaries. Instead of sticking to the typical 'Hello World' projects, I've tried to invent more challenging and fun assignments, constantly pushing myself to grow and learn.
<p>From a designer‚Äôs perspective, I would have liked the actual design layout of my final project to be more aesthetically pleasing, and needed to constantly remind myself that I was in fact a beginner at coding and should not be so hard on myself.
<p>Despite this, I'm thrilled with the progress I've made. I feel it showcases my dedication and rapid skill acquisition, which obviously involved a lot of additional reading and self-study, including diving into HTML and CSS, which had its own steep learning curve.
<p>I chose to work independently on my final project, foregoing the opportunity to collaborate with a team. This decision stemmed from my extensive background in team environments, both as a participant and a leader in the design and teaching world, as well as having a working schedule that allowed me to work unconventional hours.
</div>
  <div class="small-heading">Fun Facts</div>
<div class="additional-text">
On a personal note, as I mentioned earlier, I live off-grid in Spain, which has truly honed my skills. Achieving virtual self-sufficiency, I've mastered the art of constructing stone walls, built a swimming pool, and even wired my house to harness electricity from our solar panels.
</div><p>
  <div class="small-heading">My Oscar Finale</div>
<div class="additional-text">
And finally the thanks. I would like to thank <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/">CodeFirstGirls</a> for this great opportunity, my instructors for their support and patience, my classmates for their hearts, medals, claps and star emojis and [@Commercetools.com](https://github.com/commercetools) for sponsoring the course. 
<p>But most importantly my husband. The man that has put food and drink in front of me for the last 8 weeks. The man that has convinced me I can do this when I struggled, and the man that has done all of this with barely a grunt of thanks in return. üíñ

       It had been a hard week. My brain was completely fried from this week‚Äôs session. We had a substitute instructor who proved quite challenging to follow. I figured we could all do with a bit of a party weekend fuelled by chocolate and alcohol. My idea was to create a weekend shopping list which basically consisted of what and how many alcoholic beverages we were going to need to get over the class.
<p>
Assignment Brief : Make your own interactive project using as many of the following as possible.
+ Use if...else and conditions using comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, ‚Ä¶) or logical operators (&&, ||, !) to make decisions

+ Use let to create a variable and then reassign it
<p>Bonus : 
+ Use functions with one or more return statements
+ Combine multiple logical operators (&&, ||, !) in a condition
+ Investigate how comparison operators work with Strings
+ Research and use a switch case statement
+ Format your code neatly and use helpful variable names

For this week‚Äôs assignment, I wanted to try and include everything I had learnt in sessions 1 & 2, plus start using Arrays and Loops, plus also ask the user to add their own recommendation and bring that into the final list too. It took me longer than the previous assignments (up to version 9 this time) as I did have a few problems with the functions. But I was very happy with the final result.<p>
Assignment Brief : Create a program with a list that loops through the items in a list and outputs them in a helpful way.
You should:
+ Use an array to store values
+ Use a loop to iterate through the values in the list
+ Use interpolation and console.log to output the result
+ Use methods
<p>Bonus : 
+ Research and use unshift(), shift() and split()
+ Concatenate lists with +
+ Use a while loop
+ Research and use object methods

        <div class="additional-text">
This assignment was a little more challenging mostly because my idea required the use of an image and that alone caused problems as I don‚Äôt have a hosting account and also because I wanted the image to overlay a background that changed colour. I could have just changed my idea, but instead I began researching for a way to store images online rather than in a local directory. <p>Initially I found and used a way to store it on my Google Drive, but of course Google are not a hosting site, so I knew it wasn‚Äôt a stable option, but it worked as an interim. 
Once I had the rest of my code working, I then went back to researching for a better option. I eventually found a recommendation on Stack Exchange for Cloudinary which has been a life saver for my future and final projects too.  
<p>
I also tried a version using columns but that proved just a little bit too difficult for me at this time as I wasn‚Äôt happy with how one of the images was behaving, so I amended my design and went back to a single column layout centred in the middle of the page.
The other problem with this assignment was the instructor had problems with connection this week and wasn‚Äôt able to finish the class. We were actually given a pass with our homework, but I decided to forge ahead and finish the studies myself and submit my assignment anyway.

 <div class="small-heading">FINAL COURSE PROJECT : Car Customizer (Javascript, HTML & CSS)</div>
        <div class="additional-text">
For my final project, I wanted to expand further on what I had achieved in my previous projects.
<p>I started off by getting the actual functions to work, which I achieved in version 12, but then I wanted to improve on the design and completely lost it. I just couldn‚Äôt replicate the last part of the function again with the original car image being replaced with the patterned car image. Eventually after version 29, I asked my instructor for help. Turns out it only needed a minor adjustment. 
<p>While I was waiting for him to get back to me, I also realised the way I had set up the columns and rows was messy and causing problems, so I decided to draw a line under it all and start from scratch using a simpler method of setting up a grid.
<p>After that, it was just a matter of applying the changes my instructor had given me and then figuring out how to do a form and a pop up. 
<p>This whole project was a massive learning curve: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But I am extremely happy with what I have achieved considering at this point, I had only had 12hrs of class time.
