<div class="additional-text">
Hi, I'm Paula! üëã I'm VERY NEW to the world of coding, and I'm excited to be diving into it (along with GitHub, which is another whole new adventure for me)! <br>If you would like to connect with me, follow this link to my LinkedIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paula-harrison-a43b771b7">Paula Harrison LinkedIn</a>

<div class="small-heading">Background</div>
<div class="additional-text">
Previously from a Design for Print background and now an online Business English teacher in Spain focussing mainly on senior executives at <a href="https://es.nttdata.com/">NTT Data</a>. <p>Currently, I'm living off-grid in Spain, which adds an interesting twist to my learning journey.

<div class="small-heading">Learning Journey</div>
<div class="additional-text"> 
In March, I completed a <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/">CodeFirstGirls</a> Kickstarter course in JavaScript, and what a ride that was!! Now at the end of May, I have also completed the <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/">CodeFirstGirls</a> Kickstarter course in Python.
<p>Although in the past I dabbled with web design using programs like Dreamweaver or Wix, in the last 5 months I've learned JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, CodePen, PyCharm, Replit, Glitch, Slack, GitHub (still to be determined). Which thinking back now is pretty amazing considering the actual instructional part of the each course totalled 12 hours with the additional last 4 hours being about our final projects.
<p>I've spent every waking spare minute of my day coding. I've gone to bed counting code instead of sheep, I've woken up earlier than I needed to, just so I could do some coding before I started work. I've argued daily with Chat GPT when it gave me advice that I knew was wrong. I've found my conversations now consist of words like loop, array, conditions, functions, string. I battled internally every day as to why this has to be done with code, when drag and drop sufficed in the past, and why my design is limited because of my lack of coding knowledge.
<p>I'm exhausted, I'm exhilarated. I pushed my boundaries to the limit. I feel like I've run a marathon, which is amazing because these days I don't run anywhere. But most of all I'm really proud of what I've achieved.
<p>It's been a hell of a ride!! üòÅ

<div class="small-heading">Approach</div>
<div class="additional-text"> 
I'd describe myself as self-driven, proactive, and slightly obsessive (in the best possible way!). When faced with challenges, I tackle them head-on, fueled by my motivation to achieve my goals effectively. 
<p>I have a natural inclination towards analysis, which helps me excel at dissecting complex problems and engineering innovative solutions (normally in the middle of the night).
<p>I'm also the queen of multi-tasking and have great time management skills.
</div>
          <hr>
  <div class="small-heading">Communication</div>
<div class="additional-text"> 
Effective communication is key, and I pride myself on my excellent communication skills. Whether it's interacting with colleagues or stakeholders, I strive to ensure that communication is clear and productive. Aparrently I'm a protagonist by nature and a great Team Leader üòâ
</div> <p>
    <hr>
  <div class="small-heading">Project Approach</div>
<div class="additional-text">
Throughout the JavaScript course, I made it a point to push the boundaries. Instead of sticking to the typical 'Hello World' projects, I tried to invent more challenging and fun assignments, constantly pushing myself to grow and learn.
<p>From a designer‚Äôs perspective, I would have liked the actual design layout of my final project to be more aesthetically pleasing, and needed to constantly remind myself that I was in fact a beginner at coding and should not be so hard on myself.
<p>Despite this, I'm thrilled with the progress I made. I feel it showcases my dedication and rapid skill acquisition, which obviously involved a lot of additional reading and self-study, including diving into HTML and CSS, which had its own steep learning curve.
<p>I found the Python course easier. It really helped that I had learnt most of the vocabulary on the JavaScript course. Once I had figured out how to use PyCharm, it was plane sailing really. However, I was a little dissapointed that I couldn't showcase my code from the front end in the same way as I could with my JavaScript using CodePen, so I set myself the challenge of finding a similar online program where I could create some html, css and JavaScript to run with my Python code. That's where Replit came in.
<p>I chose to work independently on both my final projects, foregoing the opportunity to collaborate with a team. This decision stemmed from my extensive background in team environments, both as a participant and a leader in the design and teaching world, as well as having a working schedule that allowed me to work unconventional hours.

  <div class="small-heading">Fun Facts</div>
<div class="additional-text">
On a personal note, as I mentioned earlier, I live off-grid in Spain, which has truly honed my skills. Achieving virtual self-sufficiency, I've mastered the art of constructing stone walls, built a swimming pool, and even wired my house to harness electricity from our solar panels.

And finally the thanks. I would like to thank <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/">CodeFirstGirls</a> for this great opportunity, my instructors for their support and patience, my classmates for their hearts, medals, claps and star emojis and <a href="https://commercetools.com/">Commercetools.com</a> and <a href="https://www.iptiq.com/">iptiQ.com</a>
 for sponsoring the courses. 
<p>But most importantly my husband. The man that put food and drink in front of me so I wouldn't starve. The man that convinced me I could do this when I struggled, and the man that has done all of this with barely a grunt of thanks in return. üíñ
